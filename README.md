### YOU
Build a small application using SQL and PL/SQL.
### BLACKBOX.AI



Building a small application using SQL and PL/SQL can be a great way to demonstrate the capabilities of these technologies. Below, I'll outline a simple application for managing a library system. This application will allow users to manage books, authors, and borrowers. 

### Application Overview

**Features:**
1. Add new books and authors.
2. Borrow and return books.
3. View available books and borrowed books.

### Database Schema

We'll create three tables: `authors`, `books`, and `borrowers`.

1. **Authors Table**
   - `author_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `birthdate`

2. **Books Table**
   - `book_id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `author_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `is_borrowed` (Boolean)

3. **Borrowers Table**
   - `borrower_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `book_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `borrow_date`
   - `return_date`

### SQL Scripts to Create Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE authors (
    author_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    birthdate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR2(200) NOT NULL,
    author_id NUMBER,
    is_borrowed CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'N',
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id)
);

CREATE TABLE borrowers (
    borrower_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    book_id NUMBER,
    borrow_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id)
);
```

### PL/SQL Procedures

1. **Add Author**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_author(p_name IN VARCHAR2, p_birthdate IN DATE) AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO authors (name, birthdate) VALUES (p_name, p_birthdate);
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

2. **Add Book**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_book(p_title IN VARCHAR2, p_author_id IN NUMBER) AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO books (title, author_id) VALUES (p_title, p_author_id);
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

3. **Borrow Book**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE borrow_book(p_borrower_name IN VARCHAR2, p_book_id IN NUMBER) AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE books SET is_borrowed = 'Y' WHERE book_id = p_book_id AND is_borrowed = 'N';
    
    IF SQL%ROWCOUNT = 0 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Book is already borrowed or does not exist.');
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO borrowers (name, book_id, borrow_date) VALUES (p_borrower_name, p_book_id, SYSDATE);
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

4. **Return Book**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE return_book(p_book_id IN NUMBER) AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE books SET is_borrowed = 'N' WHERE book_id = p_book_id;
    
    IF SQL%ROWCOUNT = 0 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, 'Book does not exist or is not borrowed.');
    END IF;

    UPDATE borrowers SET return_date = SYSDATE WHERE book_id = p_book_id AND return_date IS NULL;
    COMMIT;
END;
/
```

5. **View Available Books**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE view_available_books AS
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM books WHERE is_borrowed = 'N') LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Book ID: ' || rec.book_id || ', Title: ' || rec.title);
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```

### Example Usage

You can call these procedures to manage your library system. Here are some examples:

1. **Add Authors**
```sql
BEGIN
    add_author('J.K. Rowling', TO_DATE('1965-07-31', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
    add_author('George R.R. Martin', TO_DATE('1948-09-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
END;
/
```

2. **Add Books**
```sql
BEGIN
    add_book('Harry Potter and the Sorcerer''s Stone', 1);
    add_book('A Game of Thrones', 2);
END;
/
```

3. **Borrow a Book**
```sql
BEGIN
    borrow_book('Alice', 1);
END;
/
```

4. **Return a Book**
```sql
BEGIN
    return_book(1);
END;
/
```

5. **View Available Books**
```sql
BEGIN
